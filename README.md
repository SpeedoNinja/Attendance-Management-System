Attendance Management System (C++)
This is a simple console-based Attendance Management System built in C++. It allows for basic student registration, admin login, and some placeholder functionalities for attendance tracking.

Features
Admin Login: Secure access for administrators with a predefined username and password.

Student Registration: Admins can register new students, storing their details like name, username, password, roll number, address, father's name, and mother's name.

Student Login: Students can log in using their registered credentials.

Attendance Marking (Placeholder): A menu option for students to "Mark Attendance for Today" (functionality to be implemented).

Attendance Count (Placeholder): A menu option for students to "Count my Attendance" (functionality to be implemented).

Admin Operations (Placeholders):

Delete all registered students.

Delete a student by roll number.

Check the list of registered students by username.

Check the presence count of a student by roll number.

Get a list of all students with their attendance count.

Data Storage: Student credentials and basic information are stored in .dat files.

How to Compile and Run
Save the code: Save the provided C++ code as main.cpp.

Compile: Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved main.cpp. Then run:

g++ main.cpp -o attendance_system

Run: Execute the compiled program:

./attendance_system

Admin Credentials
Username: admin

Password: admin@2

Future Improvements
This project is a basic foundation. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Implement Core Functionality: The attendance marking and counting features for both students and admins are currently placeholders. These need to be fully implemented, possibly by storing attendance records in separate files.

Improved Data Handling:

Use a more robust data structure or a simple database (like SQLite) instead of plain text files for better data management and querying.

Encrypt passwords for better security.

User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) could be developed using libraries like Qt or GTK+ for a more user-friendly experience.

Error Handling: More comprehensive error handling for file operations and user inputs.

Date-based Attendance: Implement a system to mark attendance for specific dates.

Reporting: Generate attendance reports (e.g., monthly, by subject).

Student Information Management: Allow admins to view and edit student details.
